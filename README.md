# Electric Vehicle Population Dashboard – Washington State

An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing Electric Vehicle (EV) population data across Washington state. This project highlights EV adoption trends, regional distribution, manufacturer dominance, and electric range patterns.

---

## 📊 Overview

This dashboard was built to explore and communicate insights from publicly available EV registration data in Washington. It offers a multi-dimensional view of:

- Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) distributions
- Popular EV manufacturers and models
- Electric range patterns over model years
- Geographic adoption trends by county and city

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📍 **Regional Distribution**: Interactive map showing EV registrations across counties and cities  
- 📈 **EV Growth Trend**: Line chart showing BEV/PHEV adoption growth over time  
- 🏭 **Manufacturer Analysis**: Visual breakdown of EV makes and their popularity (Tesla, Ford, Nissan, etc.)  
- ⚡ **Electric Range & Model Year**: Scatter plot mapping range vs. model year, color-coded by brand  
- 🧮 **Summary KPIs**: Total EVs, PHEVs, BEVs, and top manufacturer metrics  
- 🎚️ **Slicers**: Filters for dynamic exploration by region, model year, and vehicle type
